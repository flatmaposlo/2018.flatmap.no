  "<p>As I dove into yet another Clojure codebase, it was whispering very quietly. I couldn’t quite figure out what
   it was saying, but it caught my attention.</p>
   
  <p>A couple of months later, I finally understood.</p>

  <p>Although it was written in Clojure, it was just a java app in disguise!</p>"
description:
  "<p>As you first begin to program functionally, you grasp for tools like map, filter, and reduce, and you think 
  you’re done.</p>
  
  <p>Then you start to realise there is this other thing, composability.</p>

  <p>In this talk I’ll demonstrate how Java programs often lack the composability property. I’ll then proceed to 
  show what this looks like when translated to Clojure. Finally, I’ll provide some techniques to avoid this all 
  together and write code that is truly composable.</p>"

  bio:
    "<p>Erik works as a tech lead at Ardoq, a company in the EA space. He’s a mainly a backend programmer, 
    but tends to work wherever the code is bad enough. Given time he’ll eventually drift into some sort of 
    devops role while trying to figure out how to run the current project even better.</p>
    
    <p>Lately, he’s been lurking around open-source Clojure projects looking for easy bugs to fix. This is 
    his way of paying back to the community.</p>"
