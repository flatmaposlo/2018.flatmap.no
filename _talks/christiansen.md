  "<p>Dependent types let the same language be used to write types and the programs 
  they describe. They also let us write mathematical proofs using the tools we know 
  from functional programming. Based on an upcoming book, “The Little Typer”, I’ll show 
  the core ideas from dependently typed programming.</p>"
description:
  "<p>Dependent types let us use the same programming language for compile-time and 
  run-time code, and are inching their way towards the mainstream from research languages 
  like Agda and Idris. Dependent types are useful for programming, but they also unite 
  programming and mathematical proofs, allowing us to use the tools and techniques we 
  know from programming to do math as well, and allowing us to run our proofs as 
  programs. </p>
  
  <p>The essential beauty of dependent types can sometimes be hard to find under layers 
  of powerful automatic tools. Dan Friedman and I have been working on a presentation of 
  the fundamental ideas in The Little Typer, an upcoming book in the tradition of 
  The Little Schemer. As part of the effort, we have created Pie. Pie is a little 
  dependently typed language, small enough to understand completely but big enough to 
  write a variety of proofs and programs.</p>
  
  <p>Come get a taste of Pie, and see for yourself where dependent types can take us. </p>"

  bio:
    "<p>David Christiansen works at the border between type theory and type practice. 
    Together with Dan Friedman, he is a co-author of the upcoming book The Little Typer, 
    a friendly introduction to the essential ideas behind dependent types. He has done work 
    on Idris, especially its interactive environment and metaprogramming facilities, as 
    well as work on integrating Racket’s macro system with a dependent type theory. Now, 
    he is a researcher/engineer at Galois, Inc.</p>"
