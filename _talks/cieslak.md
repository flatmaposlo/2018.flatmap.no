  '<p>Javascript has conquered the world – you can use it in the browser, on the server, to write mobile apps, 
  or on the desktop with Electron. During the workshop I’ll introduce Fable - an open source compiler that brings 
  all the power of F# - the functional paradigm, static typing with type inference, pattern matching, and more 
  modern language features – to this huge and rich JS world. Fable doesn’t add any runtime overhead and generates 
  clean JS code in conformance with new ES6 patterns, like modules or iterables, making it compatible with modern 
  development tools such as webpack or babel. Also, Fable is not only for front-end web apps, it integrates with 
  the whole JS ecosystem including server-side node apps, desktop with Github Electron and mobile with Fuse or 
  React Native. During the workshop participants will learn how to use Fable with different types of 
  applications, including client side web applications, server APIs, and mobile applications.</p>'
