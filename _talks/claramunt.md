abstract:
  "<p>What if we use math to solve programming problems? Let’s take a tour through lambda calculus, the Curry-Howard 
  equivalence, and category theory, and explore the relationship of math and programming, the rich span of possibilities 
  opened by it, and why that matters.</p>"
description:
  "<p>Why the work of two different mathematicians trying to lay the foundations for mathematics ended up being directly 
  used to program computers? How programming and constructive logic are tied together and can be seen as two sides of the 
  same coin? How a theory created to overcome the paradoxes of set theory is fundamental to programming and used to write 
  better behaved programs? Why a branch of abstract math invented to justify natural transformations is very popular with 
  (functional) programmers?</p>
  
  <p>We often use programming to solve math problems, but … what if we use math to solve programming problems?</p>

  <p>Is programming… math?</p>

  <p>Let’s take a tour through lambda calculus, the Curry-Howard equivalence, and category theory, and explore the 
  relationship of math and programming, particularly in functional programming and the rich span of possibilities that 
  this relationship entails and why that matters.</p>
