  "<p>Scalaz 8 is the latest edition of the popular functional programming library for 
  Scala. In this whirlwind tour, maintainer John A. De Goes discusses some of the hottest features of 
  Scalaz 8, including all of the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A fast, concurrent, and leak-free effect system, which has small, composable, and powerful 
    primitives for building practical, real-world software;</li>
    <li>A non-linear type class hierarchy, which permits a more powerful hierarchy that infers 
    well without devastating ambiguous implicit errors;</li>
    <li>Concise, beautiful, and efficient support for polymorphic values, which generalizes 
    polymorphic functions;</li>
    <li>A powerful set of testing primitives to make easy work of testing functional code.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this tour, you’ll see how the design of Scalaz 8 was inspired by a desire to provide Scala 
  developers with a principled, performant, and pragmatic library that never sacrifices the safety 
  and equational reasoning properties of functional programming. You’ll see live code snippets that 
  show you how solving complex real world problems is simpler, faster, safer, and more reasonable 
  than in previous versions of Scalaz. And hopefully you’ll be inspired at just how far functional 
  programming in Scala has come in the past decade.</p>"

  bio:
    "<p>John A. De Goes has been functional programming for more than seven years at multiple 
    companies, and has assembled world-renowned Scala and PureScript engineering teams, trained 
    new developers in Scala and PureScript, and developed several successful open source FP 
    projects. Known for his ability to take very complex concepts and explain them simply, John 
    has taught numerous workshops and classes, including several highly-regarded workshops on 
    Scala and PureScript. John moonlights as an instructor for LambdaConf, but his primary job is 
    Chief Technology Officer of SlamData, an open source software company using pure functional 
    programming to redefine analytics for modern data.</p>"
