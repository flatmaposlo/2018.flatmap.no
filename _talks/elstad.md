abstract:
  "<p>How would Church encoding look if you try to implement it in a concatenative language? 
  Can it even be done? In this talk we’ll try to do just that, more or less live, and on the 
  way we’ll learn about concatenative programming, and the deep relations between concatenative 
  and functional programming. </p>"
description:
  "<p>Concatenative programming sometimes feels like peeking into a mirror world, where function 
  composition became the basic unit instead of function application. Familiar concepts glimmer 
  with new and exciting reflections, and before you know it, it’s four o’clock in the morning, 
  and you’re still struggling with making subtraction work.</p>
  
  <p>Armed with the home-brewed language STCK, we’ll examine how Alonzo might have implemented 
  booleans and numbers, if he had worked with a concatenative languages instead of lambda calculus. 
  On the way we’ll learn about concatenative programming languages, and explore the deep relations 
  between concatenative and functional programming.</p>

  <p>You don’t have to know anything about concatenative programming to enjoy this talk, but some 
  familiarity with lambda calculus might help.</p>

  bio:
    "<p>Teodor works at Computas, where he’s currently busy telling everybody that Charles Moore ran 
    a very successful consulting firm using Forth, among other things. He’s passionate about 
    programming as an creative process, and he strongly belive that fun fosters innovation. 
    When he’s not coding for hire, he enjoys making programs that run for a while and only makes the 
    machine hot. In the future he hopes to eliminate this unfortunate side-effect as well.</p>"
