  "<p>Design Drive Development, CQRS, Event Sourcing and Elixir all in one talk. 
  Sounds fun? In this talk we’ll go over all of these and how they can work in 
  tandem to give your apps the separation of concerns and scalability they need.</p>"
description:
  "<p>Umbrella apps are a type of Elixir (and Erlang) application that allow you to 
  have nested OTP applications as part of the same bigger ecosystem. You can think of 
  them as a sort of microservice architecture in which the bulk of the infrastructure 
  work is handled for you by the VM. It makes super nice and easy to handle inter 
  dependencies, integration testing, different scaling needs, distribution, etc… A part 
  of extracting multiple apps is thinking where to define the boundaries, that’s where 
  DDD, bounded contexts and aggregates come into play, and even though they are not 
  something that came out of the Elixir or Erlang communities is something that is 
  being discussed a lot as a way to build more maintainable, scalable and adaptable application.</p>"
