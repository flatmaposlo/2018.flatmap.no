  <p>Why is it so hard to build a good IDE for Scala? Compared to JavaScript or Clojure, one would 
  think that static types in Scala make it easier to provide a great editor experience. With the 
  introduction of the Language Server Protocol, things may be changing for the better.</p>
  
  <p>The Language Server Protocol aims to solve a long-standing issue: implement a “language server” 
  once and automatically support a wide range of client editors. The protocol was published in 2016 
  and has since then gained significant traction with implementation for over 26 programming languages 
  and most major editors. A search on the VS Code extension marketplace yields 5 (!) hits for Scala language 
  servers. A working group has recently been elected by the community to consolidate efforts around Scala 
  language servers.</p>
      
  <p>In this talk, you will learn about the Language Server Protocol, how it’s impacting the future of 
  Scala tooling and help you explore the zoo of ongoing efforts to build Scala language servers. I will 
  share my experiences from implementing Metals, a language server that supports completions, code 
  navigation, refactoring, linting and formatting, build and test. Hopefully, you will become inspired 
  at the end to join the efforts in building a bright future for Scala tooling.</p>"
