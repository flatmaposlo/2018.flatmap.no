  '<p>Gentle introduction to Scala and without to much focus on the new scary concepts such as

  '<p>Scala and functional programming can be scary at first for those of us coming from the OOP world. 
  With a bunch of new concepts such as immutability, first-class functions, implicits, and a ton of language 
  features, it is easy to get overwhelmed when jumping into Scala. We will take a look at some of the major 
  advantages of Scala and why you should start using it. Walking away from this session you will have a 
  good starting point for starting with Scala without needing to know what monads and applicative 
  functors are. </p>'
