  what other poor (algebraic) structures we can free from the dirty hands of imperative programmers.</p>"

  "<p>Have you ever asked yourself why we only free monads? Turns out there are a lot of other structures that
  want to be liberated from the constraints of their existence! In this talk we will investigate what other
  poor (algebraic) structures we can free from the dirty hands of imperative programmers.</p>

  <p>Our journey starts with the well known Free Monads, but after that we will have a look at all the
  other interesting structures that can be freed and of course we will also look at what we can do with them.</p>

  <p>Knowledge of type classes like Monads, Applicatives and Functors is beneficial but not required. </p>"
