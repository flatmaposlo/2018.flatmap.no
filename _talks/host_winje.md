title:
  "Lambda Calculus Beep Boop"
type:
  "Presentation"
abstract:
  "<p>We present beep boop, a representation for lambda calculus terms inspired by sound. It is a humane
  alternative to de Bruijn notation. It is much easier to utter a sequence of symbols in beep boop than
  in traditional lambda-based representations. Pretty useful for humans! </p>"
description:
  "<p>We know that we can represent all kinds of things in lambda calculus, including sophisticated data
  structures such as booleans, integers, and lists, but what about the representation of the lambda calculus
  terms themselves? Different representations have different strengths and weaknesses. In this talk we present
  beep boop, a novel representation for lambda calculus terms inspired by sound. It is derived from and shares
  many properties with de Bruijn notation, but offers a more humane interface to calculation. For instance, it
  is much easier for a human to pronounce a sequence of symbols in beep boop (effectively sounds) than in
  traditional lambda-based representations. This opens up exciting new possibilities that we’ll explore in
  this talk. </p>"

    "<p>Einar W. Høst is a computer at NRK, the Norwegian public broadcaster. His heretic views include
    thinking before programming and making drawings to understand things better. This arrogant mindset no
    doubt stems from the idle years spent obtaining a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oslo. </p>"
