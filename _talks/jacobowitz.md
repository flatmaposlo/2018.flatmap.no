abstract:
  "<p>Tagless Final has been a hot topic the last couple of years. It’s a great concept, but we can make 
  it even better! This talk aims to look at some more advanced techniques like making any inspecting and
  generically optimizing tagless final programs and discover different libraries on the way. </p>"
description:
  "<p>Tagless Final has been a hot topic the last couple of years. In many ways it is a great concept 
  allowing us to radically separate problem description from implementation, while also having close 
  to zero overhead in terms of performance and boilerplate. However, there are still some drawbacks 
  that usually come up when discussing trade-offs with other solutions. This talk aims to mitigate 
  these drawbacks and to give a sufficient introduction to some more advanced techniques dealing with 
  tagless final. We will work out a way to make any tagless final program stack-safe, look at different 
  ways to inspect and optimize tagless final programs and discover different libraries on the way. </p> "
