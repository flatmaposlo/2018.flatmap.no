abstract:
  "<p>In this talk, I introduce the audience to functional patterns like Applicative/Monad in an easily 
  approachable way, by showing real world use-cases for them. </p>"
description:
  "<p>Although Scala’s standard library doesn’t provide a lot of abstractions for functional programming known 
  from languages like Haskell, there are projects out there which aim to fill that gap – one of them is Cats, 
  a library that provides typeclasses, instances and additional constructs to Free (pun intended) us from the 
  burden of writing the same code over and over again. I’m going to show you the benefits of using these 
  constructs in real world applications. </p>"
