  "<p>Type classes are basically just another way to achieve polymorphism in your code. Scary as 
  they may seem, it turns out the idea is pretty straightforward, yet very powerful. And there’s 
  a good chance you have already used them. Let me convince you during this live-coding session!</p>"

  "<p>In this live coding session we’re going to approach a trivial problem as if we didn’t know 
  about type classes, and see the type class concepts naturally emerge.</p>
      
  <p>We’re also going to add some implicits, to see how those two language features used together 
  allow for writing more concise and flexible code.</p>"
