abstract:
  "<p>Functional and descriptive programming techniques are used broadly at the hardware level, 
  and there’s more in common with Functors and Monoids and circuits than you might think. This 
  engaging and entertaining talk that bridges the gap between functional software and foundational 
  hardware principles</p>"
description:
  "<p>I recently completed the NAND to Tetris course (http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php) and I 
  was struck by how many functional and mathematic concepts are used at the Hardware Level. To 
  start out with, the hardware languages are all descriptive and not imperative in nature. 
  Beyond that, all the concepts I had learned on the road to programming with Haskell and 
  Purescript had direct analogues to concepts taught at the lowest levels of computing: morphisms 
  from binary boolean algebra to binary arithmatic leverage concatenation, zero identities and 
  composition: all concepts from Monoids, Functors, Monads, etc. This talk is an engaging 
  overview of surprising parallels found in hardware computing to very high level mathematic 
  concepts from functional programming.</p>"

  bio:
    "<p>Ryan Moore is a riff wrangling musician by night and a code slinging developer by 
    day (sometimes swap those I guess). Ryan currently works as a senior (what the heck
    does that mean, right) developer at MX. Ryan wrote an actual thing that compiled and 
    did actual stuff in Haskell one time and is pretty dang proud of that. As far as music 
    goes, Ryan loves free improvisation and atonal music and also has a hankering for more 
    deterministic, tonal tunes. If its loud, whimsical, frenetic or beautifully structured, 
    Ryan will probably love it, whether we’re talking burgers, pizza, code or sounds. </p>"
