title: "What Haskell taught us when we weren't looking"
layout: talk
lookAndFeel: light-green
page_name:

type:
  "Presentation"
abstract:
  "<p>Haskell, the far away language that (almost) no one uses? Not quite, this talk shows that 
  Haskell deeply influences your favorite language, subverting OO, forcing syntax and type systems 
  to evolve. Caution: after this talk you might want to use the real thing!</p>"
description:
  "<p>Haskell, the pure and lazy functional programming language, has now been around for more 
  than 25 years. It had a profound influence on many other programming languages on the JVM: Java, 
  Clojure and Scala and elsewhere: Purescript, Swift, Go (just kidding, not Go :-)). </p>
  
  <p>In this talk you will discover which Haskell constructs have made it to mainstream programming 
  languages and change the way you program today. You will also get a glimpse of the features which 
  are yet to be transferred for our greatest benefit. Warning: after this talk you might be tempted 
  to try the real thing! </p>"

    "<p>I am a Scala / Haskell developer, promoting the use of Functional Programming to sell fashion 
    at Zalando in Berlin. As a member of the Scala community, I created libraries like specs2, eff and 
    I love to share my experience about testing or functional programming at conferences or on my blog.</p>"
