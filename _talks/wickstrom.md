    "Oskar Wickström"
  bio:
    "<p>After some years of musical education, Oskar Wickström began his journey into the
    world of software. He’s currently doing remote work in Haskell, and in his spare time
    he creates screencasts at haskell-at-work.com. Among the technical topics that interest
    Oskar are functional programming, systems design, web technology, and programming languages.
    His more aesthetic side, which mostly involves music, draws him towards graphics and UI
    design every now and then. .</p>"

  "Domain Modelling with Haskell Data Structures"
type:
  "Workshop"
abstract:
  '<p>Haskell is an amazing language for domain modelling, with its expressive data types and highly
  reusable abstractions. In this workshop we will design the core of a simple project management system,
  and explore different ways of traversing and folding our data when implementing new features.</p>'
description:
  '<p>We will use Haskell data structures to model a project management system, and from there explore
  Functor, Foldable, Traversable, and maybe recursion schemes if we have time. Attendees should be
  comfortable with Haskell basics, preferably at the level of
  <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell programming from first principles</a>
  or similar. We will use the Stack build tool to keep it consistent, and that should be installed
  beforehand, together with at least a basic text editor, by all attendees.</p>'
