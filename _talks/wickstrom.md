  bio:
    "<p>After some years of musical education, Oskar Wickström began his journey into the
    world of software. He’s currently doing remote work in Haskell, and in his spare time
    he creates screencasts at haskell-at-work.com. Among the technical topics that interest
    Oskar are functional programming, systems design, web technology, and programming languages.
    His more aesthetic side, which mostly involves music, draws him towards graphics and UI
    design every now and then. .</p>"

  "Domain Modelling with Haskell Data Structures"
type:
  "Workshop"
abstract:
  '<p><b>Attendee preparation:</b><br/>
  For the ones that want to follow along on their computer, they need to prepare by following the "Setup" section:
  https://owickstrom.github.io/domain-modelling-with-haskell-workshop/
  </p>
  
  <p>Haskell is an amazing language for domain modelling, with its expressive data types and highly
  reusable abstractions. In this workshop we will design the core of a simple project management system,
  and explore different ways of traversing and folding our data when implementing new features.</p>'

  For the ones that want to follow along on their computer, they need to prepare by following the "Setup" section:
  https://owickstrom.github.io/domain-modelling-with-haskell-workshop/
  </p>

  <p>We will use Haskell data structures to model a project management system, and from there explore
  Functor, Monoid, Foldable, and ways of traversing our data. Attendees should be
  comfortable with Haskell basics, preferably at the level of
  <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell programming from first principles</a>
  or similar. We will use the Stack build tool to keep it consistent, and that should be installed
  beforehand if you want to follow along on your computer.</p>'
